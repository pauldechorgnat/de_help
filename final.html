<h1>Big Data: Velocity</h1>

In this lesson, we will cover another aspect of Big Data: <b>Velocity</b>: data is created at great speed and must be treated in the least possible time. Therefore, we need specific tools and architectures to deal with this. 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Streaming data is when data is created continuously: it is an unbounded flow of data. Each observation is created at a given moment that we will called <b>event time</b> and processed at the <b>processing time</b>. Of course the <b>event time</b> is important as it is the time at which the observations are created, which means data is supposed to be ordered by this and to reach the system that will process it in the same order. 
</p>
<p>
Yet it is not always the case. You can think of text messages: if Alice sends a message a time <i>t</i> to Bob and Carol does the same at <i>t+1</i>. If Alice has bad network connection, then it is possible that the message reaches Bob after Carol. The event times reflects rightly the chronology of the events while the processing time is not the good one. 
</p>
<p>Streaming data can be generated in a lot of different ways: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors (temperature, pressure, traffic, ...)</li>
<li>IoT (connected watches, smartphones, ...)</li>
<li>Financial time series (for High Frequency Trading for example)</li>
<li>Web metrics (sessions, logs, ... on a website for retargeting purposes)</li>
<li>CCTV for strange behaviour detection</li>
<li>Live videos (for autonomous cars or simply live streaming)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some interesting characteristics to look at</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Frequency</b>: at which rate is data created ? Is is regular ?</li>
<li><b>Size</b>: how big is the data created?</li>
<li><b>Shape</b>: what does data look like? Can it change in anyway?</li>
</ul>
